Title: Python Coffee Vending Machine Project Description

Description:

The Python Coffee Vending Machine project is a non-object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation that brings the convenience of automated coffee dispensing to life using the Python programming language. This project incorporates various functionalities to simulate the operation of a coffee vending machine, providing users with a seamless and interactive experience.

Key Features:

1. **User Interface:** The project features a simple and user-friendly interface developed using Python's built-in libraries, such as Tkinter. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with the coffee vending machine easily.

2. **Menu Display:** A dynamic menu is displayed on the interface, presenting users with a selection of coffee options, including variations such as espresso, cappuccino, and regular coffee.

3. **Customization:** Users can customize their coffee by selecting options for sugar, cream, and other additives. The program handles these preferences and adjusts the coffee preparation accordingly.

4. **Payment System:** The project includes a simulated payment system where users can input the amount of money they want to insert. The program calculates the total cost based on the selected coffee and ensures the transaction is completed once the required amount is reached.

5. **Dispensing Mechanism:** The coffee vending machine simulates the dispensing process, providing users with a visual representation of the coffee being prepared. This includes the pouring of coffee, addition of sugar and cream, and finalizing the beverage.

6. **Change Calculation:** If users insert more money than necessary, the program calculates the change and displays it on the interface, ensuring a realistic and accurate representation of a transaction.

7. **Error Handling:** The project incorporates error-handling mechanisms to address scenarios such as insufficient funds, invalid inputs, or other unexpected issues, providing a robust and user-friendly experience.

8. **Exit Option:** Users have the option to exit the program gracefully after completing their coffee selection and payment.

Overall, the Python Coffee Vending Machine project offers a comprehensive and engaging simulation of a real-world coffee vending experience, showcasing the versatility and practicality of Python for creating interactive applications without relying on object-oriented programming principles.
